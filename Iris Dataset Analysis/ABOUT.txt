### Iris Dataset Classification & Analysis
## Overview
* This project uses the classic Iris dataset to explore flower species classification based on sepal and petal features. 
* It combines data analysis and machine learning to demonstrate the fundamentals of classification tasks in data science.

## Objectives
* Perform exploratory data analysis on the Iris dataset.
* Visualize feature relationships between flower species.
* Build a classification model to predict flower types.
* Evaluate model performance using accuracy and confusion matrix.

## Tools & Technologies
* Python (Jupyter Notebook)
* Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
* Machine Learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, KNN, etc.)

## Key Highlights
* Visualized feature distributions and relationships across species.
* Encoded categorical labels and prepared data for modeling.
* Compared multiple classification algorithms.
* Evaluated model performance with metrics and visual tools.

## Outcomes
* Achieved high model accuracy using supervised learning.
* Identified which features best distinguish between species.
* Reinforced core concepts of classification using a simple, real-world dataset.

## How to Access
* The '.ipynb' file for this project has been uploaded in this directory.
