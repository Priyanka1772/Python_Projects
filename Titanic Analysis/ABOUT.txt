### Titanic Dataset Analysis
## Overview
* This project analyzes the Titanic passenger dataset to explore survival patterns based on various factors like gender, age, class, and fare. 
* It combines data preprocessing, visualization, and classification modeling to uncover key insights.

## Objectives
* Perform exploratory data analysis on Titanic passenger information.
* Identify survival rates based on demographics and ticket class.
* Clean and preprocess data for machine learning.
* Build predictive models to classify survival outcomes.

## Tools & Technologies
* Python (Jupyter Notebook).
* Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn.
* Data cleaning, feature engineering, and classification algorithms.

## Key Highlights
* Explored survival trends by age group, gender, and passenger class.
* Visualized key relationships using bar plots, heatmaps, and histograms.
* Applied logistic regression and decision tree models.
* Evaluated accuracy and confusion matrix for each model.

## Outcomes
* Identified significant features affecting passenger survival.
* Developed and tested basic classification models on historical data.
* Reinforced understanding of supervised learning with a classic dataset.
