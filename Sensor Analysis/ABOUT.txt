### Sensor Data Analysis
## Overview
* This project analyzes sensor-generated data to uncover patterns, monitor conditions, and derive insights relevant to system health or environmental behavior. 
* The focus is on processing time-series data, detecting anomalies, and visualizing sensor outputs.

## Objectives
* Load and clean raw sensor data for analysis.
* Visualize fluctuations and trends over time.
* Identify outliers, spikes, or unusual readings.
* Provide insights into system behavior based on sensor inputs.

## Tools & Technologies
* Python (Jupyter Notebook).
* Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
* Time-series analysis and statistical techniques.

## Key Highlights
* Parsed and structured timestamped data for analysis.
* Detected variations in sensor readings using rolling statistics.
* Visualized data over different time intervals for better insights.
* Demonstrated early anomaly detection through data visualization.

## Outcomes
* Built a basic framework for time-series sensor analysis.
* Identified periods of abnormal behavior and trends.
* Supported use cases like predictive maintenance and system monitoring.

## How to Access
* The '.ipynb' file for this project has been uploaded in this directory.
* Download the file and open it Jupyter Notebook or any other software.
* Explore the charts, the tables and the queries.
